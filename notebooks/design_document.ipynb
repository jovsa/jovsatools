    "New ideas, concepts and tools are constantly being created. Doing literature reviews and one off experiments for every new problem is painful. Can we create tools that can help the learning process but then be used later to solve related problem?\n",

    "> How do you figure out what do you spend your time learning? \n",
    "\n",
    "When learning new concepts and idea, it is easy to glaze over the detials and get a false sense of confidence - but the devil is always in the detials. A lot of new concepts might seem intuitive, however, actually understanding tradeoffs, decision and limits is hard from initial reading. \n",

    "When trying to solve a new problem, a lot of ideas come to mind. However there is a lot of friction in prototyping all these alternative ideas. Hence, a lot of shortcuts are taken leading to sub-optimal outcomes in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Can one auto-catalyze the learning, decision and implimentation process?\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a good aresenal of ideas, improves the quality of decisions. Making better decisions helps create better solutions. Creating better solutions should give hints/ideas what to learn next. "
