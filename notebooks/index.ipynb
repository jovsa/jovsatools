    "        * (mitigation) clone an internal verison of nbdev\n",
    "        * (mitigation) write all non-supported use case directly in the `lib` folder\n",
    "* Monolithical git repo\n",
    "    * (+) Will allow for incrementability\n",
    "    * (+) Will become canonical place with experimentation/learning will happen. This will help with compounding learning/experimentation speed.\n",
    "    * (-) Will enentually get hard to maintain?\n",
    "        * (mitigation) things don't have a lot of deps will eventually fall out/depricate\n",
